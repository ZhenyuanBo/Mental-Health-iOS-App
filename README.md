# Mental Health App

1. This is a side project that is currently being worked on under a strong collaboration effort with my friend Angela. 
2. This app is designed to help people who want to self-reflect themselves to have a better understanding of what types of needs they have fulfilled based 
on the Theory of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.
3. Users will need to note down the activities they have completed within a day and map out the types of needs they have achieved from those activities. 
4. Users will be able to review the historical data they have previously saved in this app.
5. Users will be able to create a custom report which includes matrices of their own choice from this app.
